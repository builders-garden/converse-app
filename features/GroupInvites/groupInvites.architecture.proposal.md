**Project Plan: Refactoring Group Invite Feature**

*Prepared on Monday, September 30th, 2024*

---

### **Introduction**

The purpose of this project is to refactor the group joining feature of our mobile application to improve its reliability, testability, and maintainability. This initiative is inspired by the Composable Architecture and aims to address existing bugs and inconsistencies in the group invite acceptance process.

By introducing a state machine, complete test coverage, and a dependency control pattern, we aim to streamline the feature's logic and ensure consistent behavior across various user scenarios.

---

### **Goals and Objectives**

1. **Implement a State Machine:**
   - Represent the logic around a user joining a group invite.
   - Simplify the codebase by separating business logic from UI components.

2. **Achieve Complete Test Coverage:**
   - Cover key behavioral flows, including edge cases.
   - Utilize event-driven testing for simplicity and effectiveness.

3. **Introduce a Dependency Control Pattern:**
   - Facilitate easier testing of dependency-heavy code.
   - Allow dynamic changing of dependencies at build time or runtime.

4. **Integrate with Existing Frameworks:**
   - Work with Zustand for shared state logic.
   - Use React Query for API logic.
   - Adapt patterns to consume these frameworks imperatively via JavaScript.

---

### **Deliverables**

- **State Machine Implementation:**
  - Fully functional state machine for group invite logic.

- **Group Invite Client:**
  - Endpoints for:
    - Getting metadata about group invites.
    - Accepting group invites.
    - Creating group invites.
    - Verifying user membership in groups.
  - Live version consuming Zustand and React Query.

- **Test Suite:**
  - Event-driven tests covering all key behavioral flows:
    - User has already accepted a group invite.
    - User has been booted from a group but hasn't uninstalled the app.
    - New user joining a new group.
    - Additional identified scenarios.

- **Documentation:**
  - Detailed technical documentation of the new architecture.
  - Guidelines for future feature implementations using this pattern.

- **Demonstrations:**
  - Scheduled demos to showcase progress and gather feedback.

---

### **Key Considerations**

- **Learning Curve:**
  - Investing time early in the project to understand Zustand and React Query's imperative consumption is crucial.
  - This knowledge will facilitate smoother development and integration.

- **Dependency Management:**
  - The dependency control pattern allows for flexible swapping of implementations, which is beneficial for testing and future scalability.

- **Testing Approach:**
  - Event-driven testing ensures that the application behaves correctly in response to user actions and events.
  - Focusing on behavioral flows will lead to more robust and reliable code.

- **Team Collaboration:**
  - Regular updates and open communication with the team (Naomi, Alex, Thierry, Saul, and Kyle) will ensure alignment.
  - Demonstrations and documentation will aid in knowledge sharing.

---

### **Demonstration Schedule**

- **Thursday, October 17th:**
  - **Time:** TBD
  - **Agenda:**
    - Overview of the new architecture.
    - Live demonstration of the refactored group invite feature.
    - Walkthrough of test cases and results.
    - Q&A session.

---

### **Post-Demonstration Plan**

- **Feedback Incorporation:**
  - Address any concerns or suggestions raised during the demonstration.
  - Update documentation accordingly.

- **Paternity Leave Preparation:**
  - Ensure that the team has access to all code, documentation, and resources.
  - Assign a point of contact for any questions during the leave period.

---

### **Dependencies and Risks**

- **Framework Compatibility:**
  - Ensure that the new patterns integrate well with existing codebases that use Zustand and React Query.

  - Given the upcoming paternity leave starting after October 20th, adhering to the timeline is essential.

- **Resource Availability:**
  - Collaborate with team members to mitigate any potential bottlenecks.

---

### **Conclusion**

This project aims to enhance the group's invite functionality by leveraging a robust architectural pattern that emphasizes testability and consistency. By adhering to this plan, we expect to deliver a more reliable feature that aligns with our overall application architecture and sets a precedent for future developments.
